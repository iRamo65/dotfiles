# This repo is for automating setting up my configs and env on Arch 
As I am using WSL and moving between devices

The script ranks the fastest mirros and updates the mirror list, then installs the packages and the config files.

# Requirements
- zsh (I use zsh so there is a config for it)
- git (ofc)
- rsync (for reflector when ranking mirrors)
